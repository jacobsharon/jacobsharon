## About Me

I am a board-certified Medical Laboratory Scientist with over seven years of experience performing high-complexity testing in a large clinical laboratory environment. My background includes extensive work in clinical chemistry, hematology, and coagulationâ€”routinely handling advanced diagnostic procedures such as:

- Serum and hemoglobin electrophoresis interpretation  
- Coagulation assays (PT, aPTT, Anti-Xa, STACLOT LA, Factor assays)  
- CBC morphology reviews and differential counts  
- Instrument maintenance, QC/QA compliance, and troubleshooting

Currently, I am pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science, where my academic and research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and laboratory medicine. I focus on applying machine learning and evolutionary computing to real-world healthcare challenges, particularly in the analysis of electrophoretic data and detection of lab result anomalies (e.g., IV fluid contamination in CMP/CBC panels).
