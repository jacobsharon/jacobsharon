## About Me

I am a Medical Laboratory Scientist certified by the American Society for Clinical Pathology with over seven years of experience performing high-complexity testing in a large clinical laboratory environment. My background includes extensive work in clinical chemistry, hematology, and coagulationâ€”routinely handling advanced diagnostic procedures such as:

- Serum and Hemoglobin Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Interpretation  
- Coagulation assays (PT, aPTT, Anti-Xa, STACLOT LA, Factor assays)  
- CBC and Body Fluid Analysis and Cell Differentials  
- Instrument Maintenance, QC/QA Compliance, and Troubleshooting

Currently, I am pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science, where my academic and research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and laboratory medicine. I focus on applying machine learning and evolutionary computing to real-world healthcare challenges.
